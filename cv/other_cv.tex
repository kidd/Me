\begin{rSection}{Experience}

\begin{rSubsection}{3scale, Inc - http://www.3scale.net/}{July 2011 - Present}{Software Engineer, Team Lead}{Barcelona, Spain}
\item Maintaining and developing a Ruby on Rails application to manage
  API authentication and rate limitings. Team lead since 2014.
\item Develop a code generator to create Nginx Lua configurations from
  rules introduced by the users. Also run nginx on cloud to host these
  configurations. Developed in Ruby, Lua, Nginx and Redis.
\item Work in an Nginx+Lua solution to cache calls to external apis to
  reduce the outbound traffic and be able to not get hit by rate
  limits (500rps). Highly concurrent calls and heavy redis usage. Lua,
  Nginx and Redis.
\item Write an openresty module (lua) to perform the full oauth2
  authentication process (both 2 and 3 legged).
\item Work in apitools.com (http://www.apitools.com) project from the
  beginning until current state. Nginx platform + docker to allow
  users to proxy all the outbound traffic through apitools and monitor
  and code middleware to modify the API calls. Did a talk on that in
  ApiDays Barcelona 2014. Basic usage of Docker.
\item 3scale itself is an API management company, so I've been dealing
  with different kinds of API models, authentications,
  rate\_limitings, documentation models, testing, etc...
\end{rSubsection}

%------------------------------------------------

\begin{rSubsection}{Gnuine}{December 2010 - July 2011}{Web Developer}{Barcelona, Spain}
\item First contact with web development, Ruby, and Rails. Working in
  different Ruby on Rails projects. First serious testing and Git
  usage.
\end{rSubsection}

%------------------------------------------------

\begin{rSubsection}{Intelligent Pharma - http://intelligentpharma.com/}{July 2008 - December 2010}{Developer}{Barcelona, Spain}
\item Developing Artificial intelligence software for drug discovery.
\item Evolutionary algorithms and Genetic programming.
\item Development in Perl, C++ and using unix everywhere. First usage of Mercurial.
\item coarse grained paralelization of jobs running in supercomputers
  (MareNostrum, the 2nd biggest supercomputer at that time)
\end{rSubsection}


\begin{rSubsection}{AMES S.A.}{September 2007 - 2003}{Developer}{Barcelona, Spain}
\item Developing internal applications in Dataflex, Crystal Reports, and Perl.
\item Developing industrial apps to manage machinery by reading barcodes.
\end{rSubsection}

\end{rSection}

%	TECHNICAL STRENGTHS SECTION
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{rSection}{Skills}

\item Computer Languages: Ruby, Perl, Lua, Lisp, Assembly, C (basic),
  Clojure, Smalltalk.  I'm a programming language fanatic so I've
  dabbled with lots of others (either at university or for fun):
  Python, Prolog, C++, Java, Scheme, CL,Dylan, Io, Factor, Forth,
  Shen, Erlang, Elixir, Haskell, Oz, and written some very basic lisp
  interpreters (see github).

\item Protocols \& APIs: Working experience with HTTP, JSON, XML,
  REST, MySQL, Redis, MongoDB. Some experience with lots of others:
  Postgresql, Tarantool, influxdb, mnesia, Gemstone/S, DataFlex.  No
  real world experience with those though.

\item Tools: Zsh, screen, Vim (heavy user for 5 years, written some
  plugins), Emacs (heavy user for 5 years, written some plugins and
  contributed code to  emacs itself), git, docker.

\item Passionate learner, and willing to transmit enthusiasm for
  learning technologies and balance them with the current stable
  stack. I'm quite cautious on ``The next big thing'' hypes (there is
  no silver bullet), and like to usually keep things very simple
  (\url{http://suckless.org}). I believe simplicity and uniformity
  sometimes wins 'the perfect tool for the job' x Number-of-jobs.

\item Good comunication skills and enthusiast both teacher \& learner.
\item I used to reverse engineer software (1997-2000). Most of it is
  outdated now, but my approach to problem solving stayed.

\end{rSection}

\begin{rSection}{Conferences}

  I love to attend conferences (preferably not very crouded/mainstream ones).

\item Euroclojure 2015. (Barcelona, Spain)
\item Polyconf 2014. (Postdam, Poland)
\item ApiDays Barcelona 2014. As a Speaker
\item ApiStrat EUrope 2014. As staff. (Amsterdam)
\item Lua Workshop 2103 (Toulouse, France)
\item European Lisp Symposium 2013 (Madrid, Spain)
\item Fosdem 2013 (Brussels, Belgium)
\item YAPC:EU (perl) 2009. (Lisbon, Portugal)
\item PRACE Supercomputing 2009 (Barcelona, Spain)

\end{rSection}

\begin{rSection}{Projects and Free Software}

  I'm a convinced advocate of Free software, and I have several
  projects opensourced in github (http://www.github.com/kidd), and
  I've contributed to several others. Also I've been involved in
  several open source communities. For example:

\item Member of Barcelona Perl Mongers.
\item Member of Smalltalk.cat.
\item Patch published in Vimperator (2008)
\item Closely following Emacs development. Commited some code. There's
  much to learn from a 30 year old software project at both code level
  and management level.
\item (ex-)member of Vectorlinux crew. I developed a few apps to
  package apps for vectorlinux and maintaining the repos. Also a
  migration tool for old packages to new packages, tracking
  dependencies and recursively building them in preorder.
\item Following GNU Guix development and IRC.  I package and maintain
  a few packages (luajit, openresty, xmlstarlet).
\item \href{https://github.com/areina/helm-dash}{Helm-dash.el}
  (coauthor/maintainer). Browse documentation offline from within
  emacs. It reads Dash docsets. (~170 stars)
\item
  \href{https://github.com/kidd/erc-image.el}{erc-image.el} /
  \href{https://github.com/kidd/erc-youtube.el}{erc-youtube.el}
  (author/maintainer). Visualize images inline in erc irc
  client. (Included in spacemacs project)
\item \href{https://github.com/apitools/router.lua}{router.lua}
  (author/maintainer). Trie-based router in lua using unification
  instead of simple matching, so that traveling a route is
  O(route.size).
\item \href{https://github.com/kidd/eva}{eva.lua}. supersimple and
  toy-like lisp interpreter in lua
\item \href{https://github.com/kidd/hascheme}{hascheme}(half assed
  scheme). not so supersimple but still toy-like scheme interpreter in
  Perl.
\item \href{https://github.com/kidd/redditfs.lua}{redditfs.lua}. fuse
  module written in lua to mount reddit as a file system.
\item More on github. I completed some clojure courses, and there
  are some pet projects I wrote in elixir/factor/elisp/Io \ldots

\end{rSection}

\begin{rSection}{Personal}

\item I love music (from rock and jazz to funk and psy \ldots).
\item I like reading (``obviously'', my favourite technical books are
  those that are known by their initials:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \href{https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/}{SICP}
  \item \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach}{GEB},
  \item \href{http://norvig.com/paip.html}{PAIP}
  \item \href{http://hop.perl.plover.com/}{HOP} .
  \item Currently reading
    \href{https://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/book.html}{CTM}, which seems
    to be a good candidate to enter the list).
  \end{enumerate}
\item I used to play Guitar and bass guitar.
\item I also love good conversations over beers about programming
  languages.

\item I blog in \url{http://puntoblogspot.blogspot.com} since 2008.
\item I like wordplays.
\item I currently live in \href{https://www.google.es/maps/place/Tenerife/@28.2925426,-17.0803948,9z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0xc4029effe8682ed:0xb01a4bf1c84baf3c}{Tenerife}.
\item My Cv is on \href{https://github.com/kidd/Me}{Github}
